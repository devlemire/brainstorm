# Project-Name-TBA

## Project Summary

In this project we will cover how to use middleware, utilize URL parameters, and store/retrieve data on sessions. We'll cover these concepts by creating an API that will only allow access to users who provide information about who they are. We'll store this information on a session and then allow them to use the API.
